# site_coritiba
Coritiba FC Mockup Site
- This is a simple project for the soccer team I have suppoted
since I was a kid. (It makes suffer, but the heart wants what
the heart wants.)
- This is the result of my early interaction with HTML and CSS.
I decided to publish it, although it is very basic. It reminds of
my beggining with frontend and how challenging it was.
- It sure needs some improvement, but I have been busy and I am not
sure when I will do it. Hope some time soon.
- You can check it by clicking on the github pages link to the right.
